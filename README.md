End to End ML Project
While setting up the project, first thing is to build the pipeline
there are 2 pipeline
1. Traning Pipeline
2. Prediction Pipeline

Traning Pipeline: focus to read the data, Train_test split EDA, feature engineering, model traning, model evaluation
Prediction Pipeline: Input from client end, and generate specific output. Can be in the form of API as well

or traning pipeline components: 
1. Data Source : mysql, postgres, csv
2. Data Ingestion : read from data source, & train test split
3. Data Transformation
4. Model Traning
5. Model Monitoring
6. Model Deployment
